# Widget Creator — an app that creates apps

A Reactor (WinUI 3) desktop app that turns a one-line prompt into a **single-file
Reactor app**, builds it, and launches the result inside an **MXC sandbox** with
UI + remote network but **no local filesystem** — a web-like, run-untrusted-UI
experience. The creator itself is, of course, a Reactor app.

```
prompt ─▶ GitHub Copilot SDK ─▶ single-file Reactor app (.cs)
       ─▶ dotnet build          ─▶ widget.exe
       ─▶ MXC wxc-exec          ─▶ sandboxed window (UI ✓, network ✓, local files ✗)
```

## What it demonstrates

- **Generation** — the [`GitHub.Copilot.SDK`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GitHub.Copilot.SDK)
  streams a complete single-file Reactor app from your prompt (same engine the
  `demo-script-tool` sample uses; rides your `gh auth` Copilot subscription). The
  system prompt bakes in the Reactor **Windows 11 design** rules (TitleBar, theme
  tokens, cards, 4px grid) so generated widgets look like first-class Win11 apps.
- **Build** — the generated `widget.cs` is scaffolded into a tiny
  self-contained Reactor project and built with the same platform-shaped output
  layout as the Reactor app template.
- **Sandboxed run** — the built `widget.exe` is launched by
  [MXC](https://github.com/microsoft/mxc) (Microsoft eXecution Containers) via the
  native `wxc-exec` binary under a policy that allows a visible window and
  outbound network but denies the local filesystem. MXC grants the sandbox
  read+execute on **only the app's own directory** (from
  `filesystem.readonlyPaths`); the user's profile, Documents, etc. are
  unreachable. We never touch filesystem ACLs ourselves.
- **Runtime repair** — each saved widget persists the Copilot session ID that
  created it. If the sandboxed app exits non-zero later, Widget Creator resumes
  that session, sends the crash code/output plus the current source back to the
  agent, rebuilds the repaired widget, saves the updated session metadata, and
  relaunches it.
- **Render-error visibility** — generated widgets include a fail-fast root
  `ErrorBoundary` wrapper. Render exceptions are written to stderr with a
  `WIDGET_CREATOR_RENDER_CRASH` marker and exit code `70`, so Reactor's normal
  visual fallback does not hide the failure from the repair agent. The generated
  helper also reports unhandled managed exceptions (`71`) and unobserved task
  exceptions (`72`) to stderr. It does not write crash files because the
  sandboxed app has no write access to its app directory.

## Run it

```pwsh
dotnet run --project samples/apps/widget-creator/widget-creator.csproj -p:Platform=ARM64
```

(Use `-p:Platform=x64` on an x64 machine.)

### Prerequisites

1. **Copilot auth** — install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and run
   `gh auth login --web` with a Copilot-enabled account (`gh auth status` to
   confirm). The bundled Copilot CLI rides that account.
2. **MXC** — a build of `wxc-exec.exe`. By default the app prefers a freshly
   built source binary under `…\mxc\src\target\<triple>\release\wxc-exec.exe`,
   then the bundled `…\mxc\sdk\bin\<arch>\wxc-exec.exe`. Override with:
   - `WIDGET_CREATOR_WXC_EXEC` — full path to `wxc-exec.exe`,
   - `WIDGET_CREATOR_MXC_BIN` — a `sdk\bin` dir (the app appends `arm64`/`x64`), or
   - `WIDGET_CREATOR_MXC_ROOT` — the MXC checkout root (default
     `C:\Users\andersonch\Code\mxc`).
3. **Local Reactor package** — generated widgets reference
   `Microsoft.UI.Reactor 0.0.0-local`, resolved from this repo's `local-nupkgs`
   feed. Run `mur pack-local` if it's missing. Override the feed path with
   `WIDGET_CREATOR_NUPKGS`.

Type a prompt, click **Generate & Run**. The generated source streams into the
right panel; the build + `wxc-exec` log streams below it. The widget window opens
sandboxed — close it to finish the run. If it crashes instead, the creator keeps
watching the sandbox process, restores the widget's saved Copilot session, and
asks the agent to repair the app from the crash details.

## How the sandbox policy works

The app emits an MXC `ContainerConfig` (schema `0.6.0-alpha`, `processcontainer`
backend) and runs `wxc-exec <config>.json`:

| Surface | Setting | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| UI / display | `ui.disable = false` | the widget renders a real WinUI window |
| Network | `network.defaultPolicy = allow` + `internetClient` capability | outbound HTTP(S) works |
| Filesystem | `filesystem.readonlyPaths = [appDir]` | MXC grants read+exec to **only** the app's own dir; everything else under the user profile is default-deny |
| Clipboard / input | `clipboard = none`, `injection = false` | no clipboard, no synthetic input |

MXC's tier detector chooses how to enforce that grant (BaseContainer, AppContainer
+ BFS, or AppContainer + DACL). The app never edits ACLs — declaring the app
directory in `readonlyPaths` is enough; MXC's DACL manager stamps the grant.

> **Host note (this dev machine).** The newer BaseContainer backend is gated by
> the OS build here (`Experimental_CreateProcessInSandbox → E_NOTIMPL`). The app
> sets `MXC_DISABLE_BASE_CONTAINER=1` on the `wxc-exec` process so the tier
> detector uses **AppContainer + DACL** instead, which grants the app dir and
> runs. This is harmless on hosts where BaseContainer works (it just uses the
> DACL tier). Pre-set the variable yourself to override. Requires a `wxc-exec`
> build new enough to honor that variable — hence the source-binary preference
> above.

## Layout

```
samples/apps/widget-creator/
  Program.cs                 ← ReactorApp.Run<WidgetCreatorShell>
  WidgetCreatorShell.cs      ← the UI + generate→build→sandbox pipeline
  Services/
    CopilotSdkClient.cs      ← streaming text completion via GitHub.Copilot.SDK
    IModelClient.cs
    WidgetGenerator.cs       ← system prompt + stream + ```csharp fence extraction
    WidgetWorkspace.cs       ← scaffolds widget.cs + widget.csproj + nuget.config
    WidgetBuilder.cs         ← dotnet publish (no ACL edits — MXC grants the app dir)
    MxcSandbox.cs            ← builds the ContainerConfig + runs wxc-exec
    SessionLog.cs
  Resources/SystemPrompt.txt ← instructs the model to emit one single-file Reactor app
```

## Notes & caveats

- This is a demo wired against a local MXC checkout and the repo's `local-nupkgs`
  feed — paths and schema choices are host-specific and meant to be cleaned up
  before any real submission.
- MXC is an early preview; its sandbox profiles are **not** a security boundary
  yet (see the MXC README).
- A real generation call opens an interactive Copilot CLI auth flow on first use.
